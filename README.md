# ASL-recognition
The ASL Recognition System uses a deep learning model to recognize the hand gestures corresponding to the 26 letters of the English alphabet in American Sign Language (ASL). The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and is trained on the ASL Alphabet Dataset. Once the model recognizes the gesture, it translates it into the corresponding letter.
